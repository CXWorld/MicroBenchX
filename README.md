# MicroBenchX
Micro benchmarks CPU/GPU. Assembler code is based on the great work by Nemes: https://git.nemez.net/nemes/ipc-tests/-/tree/master. The code is not comparable because it was modified!

### Install Steps Netwide Assembler (NASM)

* Download installer: https://www.nasm.us/
* Download VSNASM batch installer: https://github.com/ShiftMediaProject/VSNASM
* Create environment variable: Name=NASM, Variable Value=C:\Program Files\NASM

### To Do
A detailed readme will follow soon. Add further FP IPC tests. Add other micro benchmarks. Create a WPF UI.
